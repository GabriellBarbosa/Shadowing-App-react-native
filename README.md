# Practice your English speaking

The shadowing technique is a language learning method that involves repeating what you hear in a foreign language as closely as possible.

## This is how the App works
- You upload an audio of a native speaker (wav format pls).
- The App will split the audio into sentences.
- Record your voice repeating what you've heard.

## Example
<img src="./assets/gifs/app-intro.gif" />

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
